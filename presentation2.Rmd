library(stringi)

offices <- get_available_offices()

# Find out the exact name of the office
Bielany_office <- offices[stri_detect_fixed(offices, "Bielany")][1]
queues <- get_available_queues(Bielany_office)

# Find the exact name of the queue
queue500 <- queues[stri_detect_fixed(queues, "500+")][1]

print(get_waiting_time_verbose(Bielany_office, queue500, language = 'pl'))
print(get_number_of_people_verbose(Bielany_office, queue500, language = "pl"))
