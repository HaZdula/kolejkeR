## Get access to data regarding queues in municipal offices in Warsaw {.smaller}

The city hall of Warsaw made a variety of data public [here](https://api.um.warszawa.pl). Everyone is welcome to access the data via API, using JSON file format. One of the datasets contains the information about queues in municipal offices in Warsaw, ie. expected times, open counters and amount of people waiting. 

`kolejkeR` is an R wrapper around the API, developed as a project for Advanced R classes at the Warsaw University of Technology. It's suitable both for further data processing and analysis, as well as for quick acquirement of information helpful for everyday life in Warsaw.
