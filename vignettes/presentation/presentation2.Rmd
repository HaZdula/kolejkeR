## Get access to data regarding queues in municipal offices in Warsaw {.smaller}

The city hall of Warsaw made a variety of data public [here](https://api.um.warszawa.pl). Everyone is welcome to access the data via API, using JSON file format. One of the datasets contains the information about queues in municipal offices in Warsaw, ie. expected times, open counters and amount of people waiting. 

`kolejkeR` is an R wrapper around the API, developed as a project for Advanced R classes at the Warsaw University of Technology. It's suitable both for further data processing and analysis, as well as for quick acquirement of information helpful for everyday life in Warsaw.

## Reduced amount of dependencies

**Imports:** 

 * **jsonlite**
 * **glue**


## Dataset {.smaller}

830k obserwations, 2019-12-28 to 2020-01-22, 8:00 - 19:00. Documented
```{r dataset_example, eval=TRUE}
data("warsaw_queues")
```
```{r dataset_head, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(warsaw_queues)) %>% 
#kable_styling(c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>%
scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## New function

```{r eval=FALSE}
###<b>
append_api_data_to_csv(filename)
###</b>
```
1. Collects data from Warsaw queue api from all offices
2. Writes it to csv file

## Model



## Example {.smaller}

Where the service time is the longest?

``` {r plot_example, echo=FALSE}
select(warsaw_queues, name, czasObslugi) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(mean_time = mean(czasObslugi)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=name, y=mean_time)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("Office") +
  ylab("Mean time [min]") +
  labs(title = "Mean waiting time for offices in Warsaw") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()
```

## Dataset

Package function were used to gather data about queues in Warsaw's government offices. Data was collected on the span of couple of weeks from December 28 to January 22.
Warsaw's office API was called repeatedly every 5 minutes and results appended to csv file. KolejkeR package includes this dataset in a form of a data frame with 830172 rows and 12 variables. Uncompressed csv file with dataset takes 84.3 MB of memory.
